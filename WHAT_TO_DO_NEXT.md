# What To Do Next

This file contains all follow-up actions so no placeholder/instructional text is needed inside the HTML pages.

## 1) Brand Assets
Add these files into `assets/img/`:
- `techmachlogo.jpeg` (header logo)
- `favicon.ico` (browser tab icon)
- `Silocomplex.jpg` (hero background image)

Recommended:
- Logo PNG with transparent background, at least 600px wide.

## 2) Decimal Mono Font
If you have licensed webfont files, add them into `assets/fonts/` (for example):
- `DecimalMono-Regular.woff2`
- `DecimalMono-Bold.woff2`

Then update `assets/css/main.css` `@font-face` sources to point to those files.

## 3) Project Photos
Add your best photos here:
- `projects/cereal/cover.jpg`
- `projects/feedmilling/cover.jpg`
- `projects/seed/cover.jpg`
- Optional extras per folder: `line-01.jpg`, `line-02.jpg`, `line-03.jpg`

Recommended image quality:
- 1600px+ wide
- Landscape orientation
- JPG or WEBP

## 4) Optional Expansion (Next iteration)
- Add a dedicated Projects page with galleries per sector.
- Add partner/client logo strip on Home.
- Connect contact form to backend email handling.
- Add project case studies with measurable outcomes.

## 5) Copy Approval
Review and approve final wording in:
- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `contact.html`

If you want a more formal tone, send final approved copy and it can be swapped in directly.


## 6) Background Shuffle Images
Put your hero background images inside `backround suffle/`.
Supported formats in the current setup: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP.
You can scroll the hero area (or use Previous/Next buttons on Home) to cycle through images.
